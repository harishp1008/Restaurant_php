	<p><b>Today's Special</b></p>
<dl>
  <dt><u>Paella Valenciana</u></dt>
  <dd>Paella is perhaps the most famous Spanish dish of all, and certainly one of the most abused. Authentic paella originates from the region around Valencia, and comes in two varieties: Paella Valenciana, with rabbit and chicken; and seafood paella.</dd>
  <dt><u>Patatas bravas</u></dt>
  <dd>A staple among the small dishes that make up a classic tapas menu, patatas bravas -- "brave potatoes" -- is named for its spicy sauce, rare in a land that generally shuns fiery food.
The potatoes are cubed and shallow fried and served the same everywhere. The sauce can come in any number of ways, from spicy ketchup to garlic mayonnaise with a dusting of pimiento (smoked paprika), or both.</dd>

	<li><p>Judith S.</p><p>We were entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table. We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning </p></li>
	<li><p>Victoria C.</p><p> Hello. Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) and others for the wonderful room and bottle of sparkling wine for our Anniversary stay. We had an amazing time</p></li>
	<li><p>Anonymous</p><p> Spent 3 nights at this resort earlier this month and it was a great stay! We paid for an upgrade to the oceanfront cabana, which was worth the price. The beach views, calm ocean and ability to watch the sunset on our patio were highlights of the trip! The hotel restaurant was exceptional, not only because every meal we enjoyed</p></li>
